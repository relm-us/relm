 * GLTFLoader isn't quite supported in node.js so this
 * is a bit of hack to make it usable
 *
 * 1. load() tries to use XMLHttpRequest which doesn't exist
 *    on node. Instead we just load it ourself using fetch
 *    with is available in browsers, and polyfilled on node.
 *    It is then sent through parse() manually.
 * 2. parse() tries to call atob() on the result which node
 *    does not have. We polyfill this too.
